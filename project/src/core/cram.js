// src/core/cram.js — the CRAM layer, as CRAM and not as RNS. (P14)
//
// CORRECTION OF RECORD
// ────────────────────
// Everything this project built on the Safe Basis used it the way an RNS uses
// moduli: a flat bag of PRIMES, with the winding recovered through a
// multiplicative anchor drawn from INSIDE the basis (the gear pair 17·19 = 323)
// and a precomputed inverse M6⁻¹ ≡ 287 (mod 323). That is correct arithmetic
// and it is not CRAM. Four things were being used wrongly:
//
//  1. ANCHOR. CRAM's governing configuration is the ADJACENT anchor A = M + 1.
//     Then M ≡ −1 (mod A), so M is its own inverse and
//
//         K ≡ r − s   (mod M+1)
//
//     — one modular subtraction, no multiply, no inverse, no precomputation.
//     The shipped gear path costs a subtract, a multiply and a reduction, and
//     needs the constant 287 computed ahead of time. A = M+1 also gives a far
//     wider corridor: 30,031 against 323, a factor of 92 on the six-lane shell.
//
//  2. PRIMALITY. gcd(M, M+1) = 1 for free, so the anchor never needs a
//     primality test — and in fact is usually composite: 30,031 = 59 · 509 and
//     9,699,691 = 347 · 27,953. The addressing layer (CRT, winding, K-Elim,
//     comparison, division-by-constant) needs COPRIMALITY only. Primality is
//     needed by the FIELD layer (square root, Legendre, index), which is a
//     different stack. A safe basis is a set of pairwise-coprime positive
//     integers, not a set of primes; `adjacencyRecover` is verified below on
//     the all-composite basis {8, 9, 25, 49, 11, 13}.
//
//  3. DEGRADATION. gcd(M, A) = d > 1 does not break K-Elimination; it reduces
//     resolution to A/d. This is the Resolution Gradient, and it is where the
//     Maya Calendar Round comes from: gcd(260, 365) = 5, resolution 73, and
//     73·260 = 52·365 = 18,980. The project treated 260 and 365 only through
//     ring closure and missed that they are a K-Elimination pair.
//
//  4. SHADOW. The shadow lattice is a HIGHER-POWER anchor whose non-coprimality
//     with the basis is deliberate: 11⁶ with gcd(11⁶, M8) = 11. It lifts K to
//     modulus 11⁵ = 161,051, a corridor of M8 · 11⁵ ≈ 1.56 × 10¹². The project
//     treated 11 as a single lane and never lifted it.
//
// Kept from the RNS-shaped work: the gear path is still here as
// `generalRecover`, because it is the general case A ∤ M+1 and it is what you
// need when the anchor is fixed by something other than adjacency.
//
// BigInt only. No floats, no Date, no ephemeris.

// ─────────────────────────────

// nothing about the bridge between two. What certifies the bridge is an
// UNBROKEN SAFE BASIS: pairwise coprimality with no repeated modulus, on both
// sides. That alone makes the idempotents exist, and the idempotents are the
// whole bridge.
//
// THE BRIDGE
// ──────────
// With e_i the CRT idempotents of A (which exist exactly because A is unbroken):
//
//     Σ_i r_i·e_i  =  γ_A(r) + t·M_A        t < Σ a_i, a basis-sized constant
//     x            =  γ_A(r) + K_A·M_A
//                  =  Σ_i r_i·e_i + (K_A − t)·M_A

//
//     x mod b  =  ( Σ_i r_i·(e_i mod b)  +  W·(M_A mod b) )  mod b
//
// Nothing proportional to |x| is ever formed. The largest integer built is
// Σ r_i e_i < M_A·Σa_i — fixed by the basis, not by the value. A 43-digit x
// transduces with a 4-digit intermediate.
//
// SHARED LANES ARE THE PHASE LOCK. A lane present in both bases is copied
// across untouched; no bridging is needed and none is done. Disjointness of the

 *
 * K-Elimination's own theorem says why. In `X = r + k·M`, k is not lost

 * residue representation, and an anchor coprime to the shell provides an
 * INDEPENDENT EXACT VIEW of the same value. That is what retires k-tracking.
 * The magnitude of Φ(x) is no different from any other magnitude — it is
 * recovered the same way, by eliminating against an anchor:
 *
 *     K_B ≡ (s − γ_B) · M_B⁻¹   (mod A),      s = Φ(x) mod A

 * and Φ(x) mod A is available for ANY A from the source tray alone, because the
 * bridge gives x mod A exactly and Φ(x) mod A = Φ(x mod A) mod A.
 *
 * What the theorem does require is the RANGE HYPOTHESIS — `X < M·A` in
 * `kElimination_core`. K-Elimination is exact inside a corridor, and the
 * corridor has to be wide enough. So the caller declares DEPTH, a property of
 * the target fixture, and the anchor is lifted to A = (M_B+1)^depth. Depth is
 * the same lever the parked lane uses; nothing about Φ needs to be known.
 *
 * The lift is self-checking. The leading base-A digit of the recovered winding
 * is zero exactly when the previous depth already sufficed, so a NON-ZERO
 * leading digit proves the corridor was too narrow and the transduction is
 * refused. A zero leading digit is necessary for being inside the corridor, and
 * is reported as such — `leading_digit_zero`, not a proof of containment.
 *
