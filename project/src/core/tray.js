// src/core/tray.js — the two-tray architecture. (P28)
//
// EVERYTHING BOILS DOWN TO THIS.
//
//   1. The FIRST TRAY — the CRT fixture — holds the Safe Basis, whose product
//      space is 100% SATURATED at 30,030. Saturated means the CRT map
//      ∏ ℤ/p_iℤ → ℤ/Mℤ is a bijection with no slack: every residue tuple names
//      exactly one value and every value has exactly one tuple. No redundancy,
//      no unreachable codepoints.
//
//   2. Coupled with the 36/37 STAR LIFT this instantiates the ARROW OF TIME.
//      S₃ = 37 with shell 36 = S₄ − S₃ gives the winding tower arbitrary depth,
//      and the winding is monotone, so the natal state is unreachable once
//      wound. Depth plus monotonicity is the arrow.
//
//   3. THE FIRST TRAY IS LEFT UNBROKEN. It is the only thing that has to be.
//
//   4. A SECOND TRAY IS PHASE LOCKED to it through the prime 11 lane and the
//      recommissioned unit lane 1 — phase and origin.
//
//   5. The second tray INHERITS primality, coprimality and the identity of a
//      number from the first through that lock.
//
//   6. Therefore the second tray may hold ARBITRARY COMPOSITES, with no heed of
//      primality or coprimality.
//
// Point 6 is the payoff and it follows from point 5, not from anything about
// the second tray's own moduli. A lane of the second tray is a READING — x mod q
// is exact for every q, coprime or not — and readings do not need to be
// independent to be exact. What coprimality buys is the ability to RECONSTRUCT
// from the tray alone, and the second tray never has to: the identity (r, w)
// lives in the first.
//
// This is why `certifyTransduction` requiring BOTH bases to be unbroken was
// wrong. Only the source must be.
//
// BigInt only.
